This project has no name.

How to install:

Create a database (currently only mysql is supported) and dump the schema
into it (sql/mysql.sql).

Add a user to the database (there is currently no admin interface).  Just
set the username and password fields in users to plaintext values.

Copy the contents of the src directory to a directory that will let you
execute them as PHP scripts.

Edit the funcs.php and vars.php files.

Go to whatever you set the $base_uri variable to, type in your username and
password, and you're all set.
