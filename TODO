Things that need to or should be done to make this thing not suck as bad.
    This may or may not be in order of importance.

* Fix the file locations, everything's pretty random right now.
* Add functions to take the place of the duplicate code (ie error handling)
* When moving a link into a folder, make it obvious what the folder layout
  should be.
* Allow the user to enter bookmarks from scratch rather than having to use
  the browser buttons.
