Things that need to or should be done to make this thing not suck as bad.
    This may or may not be in order of importance.

* Add functions to take the place of the duplicate code (ie error handling)
* When moving a link into a folder, make it obvious what the folder layout
  should be.
* Allow the user to enter bookmarks from scratch rather than having to use
  the browser buttons.
* Stop using the base_uri variable (there are nicer ways to figure that
  out)
* An admin interface for things such as adding/removing users.

Wishlist items (these are very low priority).

* Add support for other databases.
* Drag and drop bookmark/folder movement.
